To Do:
- Change the output of the game results from text to image-based (appears to be easier with OOP)
	+ Add images in response to player 1 input
	+ Add images in response to player 2 input
	+ Keep a history of past 10 turns in the form of images
		+ Find a way to add multiple image objects cleanly
		+ Find a way to move multiple image objects together cleanly
	+ Every time a new turn is played, move up all other images
	- Add a scroll bar to the canvas so that the history can be seen?
	+ Change the colour of the image so that it is obvious who won
	- Grey-out past moves

- Re-organize GUI to fit within a smaller screen or find a way to re-adjust widget/window sizes without cutting off widgets

- Implement machine learning algos to work in real-time

- Train additional models to play with


Done:
+ Start a game / reset a game
+ To allow button and keyboard input
+ Keep track of score / history
+ maybe: selection of opponent strategy
+ Add unit tests
+ Change GUI to object-oriented
